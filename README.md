## FABLAB
A Fablab is equipped with an array of flexible computer-controlled tools that cover several different length scales and various materi ,with the aim to make "almost anything".This include technology-enabled products generally perceived as limited to mass production.
## FABLAB AT MECSE

Fablab at mesce consist of 3D printer,CNC,Laser cutter etc...

## DAY 2
Today we leanrt of how to document our project into GitHub pages.Also they gave us a description to 3d printer and teach us to how to use it properly.

## DAY 4
A vinyl cutter is a type of computer-controlled machine.The computer controls sharp movement of a sharp blade.This table is used to cut out shapes and letters from sheets of thin self-adhesive plastic(vinyl).<br/>
STES<br/>
1.Find an image that you want to make into a sticker.<br/>
2.Import the image into CutStudio.<br/>
3.Adjust the scale and accuracy of cut.<br/>
4.Load the piece of vinyl into the machine.<br/>
5.press the cut button.<br/>

## DAY 5
3D printing also known as additive manufacturing,refers to processes to create a three-dimensional object in which layer of material are formed under computer control to create an object.

Today we first installed autoCAD software inorder to design our model.Rhinoceros is used.
STEP 1:<br/>
Develep a concept for 3D printing and and convert it into one of the format using Rhinoceros(any 3D modelling software).<br/>
STEP 2:<br/>
Load the converted 3D model from Rhinoceros software into Cura.Then adjust the model's scale and other properties.<br/>
STEP 3:<br/>
The next step is printing the model we designed using Ultimaker 2+.<br/>
For that 
1.We have to copy the  file from CURA  into SD card.<br/>
2.Check and correct the display settings on the Ultimaker 2+.
3.print
4.Detatch the printed model from the 3D printer.<br/>
5.Remove sopport from 3D printed model.
## DAY 6
Detailed description about LASER CUTTER,CNC.
