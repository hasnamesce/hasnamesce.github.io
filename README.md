COURSE CONTENTS  .    


DAY 1:Introduction to Fablab<br/>
DAY 2:Github pages and documentation<br/>
DAY 3:Electronics production and CNC<br/>
DAY 4:Vinyl cutting<br/>
DAY 5:Screen printing<br/>
DAY 6:3D printing<br/>


## DAY 1
First day we got an introduction to "How to make almost anything".<br/>
## DAY 2
Today we leanrt of how to document our project into GitHub pages.Also they gave us a description to 3d printer and teach us to how to use it properly.
## DAY 3
3D printing also known as additive manufacturing,refers to processes to create a three-dimensional object in which layer of material are formed under computer control to create an object.
Today we first installed autoCAD software inorder to design our model.Rhinoceros is used.
STEP 1:<br/>
Develep a concept<br/>
STEP 2:<br/>
Hop on computer
STEP 3:<br/>
Get access to a 3d printer<br/>
## DAY 4
detailed description about LASER CUTTER,VINYL CUTTER,CNC.
